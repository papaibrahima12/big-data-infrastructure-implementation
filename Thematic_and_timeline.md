## Context

With the advent of the digital age, the amount of data generated, stored and shared has
increase. From data warehouses, web pages and blogs to audio/video streams, all
these elements are sources of massive amounts of data. The result of this
proliferation is the generation of massive amounts of ubiquitous and complex data,
that must be efficiently created, stored, shared and analyzed to extract
useful information.

## Problem
Let's assume that UMMISCO holds large amounts of data from various sources (satellite data,
raw data, drone images, . . . ). Following the current trend with ever-increasing needs, this
traction generates an almost exponential increase in the digital data to be managed.

## Proposed Solution

Several solutions are available to us: A distributed system based on Hadoop or a cloud-based system, but we will opt for the establishment of a hardware and software infrastructure based on a distributed system making it possible to support the tasks of exploration and exploitation of this massive data.

## Objectives
- Complete infrastructure meeting standards
- papers for scientific journal or workshop

## Targeted Workshops

We should decide to which one of those workshops we want to submit

| Workshop | URL | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| complete pharo's apprenticeship | https://www.fun-mooc.fr/fr/cours/programmation-objet-immersive-en-pharo/ | March 01st |
| Doing LinkedList Exercise in pharo Mooc Week 3 | February 16th |
| finish learning big data tools: spark, hadoop, hive,... |  | March 01th |

## Timeline

| Period | Expected Results |
|---|---|
| **1st month** | Needs studies and design of the massive data infrastructure |
| **2nd month** | Installation of the components of the infrastructure (systems of storage, compute servers, networks, security tools) |
| **3th month** | Commissioning of the infrastructure |
| **4th month** | Infrastructure testing |
| **5th month** | Infrastructure maintenances |

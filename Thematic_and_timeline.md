##Title 

Design and Implementation of a Big Data infrastructure for UMMISCO

##Problem 

The objective of this system is then to allow the management, the storage and processing of large quantities of varied data (images, sounds, videos, texts, etc.) from different sources (drones, sensors, satellites, raw data, etc.) to then exploit and visualize them. The problem is the following: How could we effectively manage all this data while optimizing resources necessary for their processing and visualization? 

#Proposed Solution: 
Several solutions are available to us: A distributed system based on Hadoop or a cloud-based system, but we will opt for the establishment of a hardware and software infrastructure based on a distributed system making it possible to support the tasks of exploration and exploitation of this massive data.

#Timeline:
    -1 month - Needs studies and design of the massive data infrastructure
    -2 month - Installation of the components of the infrastructure (systems of storage,        compute servers, networks, security tools)
    -3 month - Infrastructure testing
    -4 month - Commissioning of the infrastructure
    -5 month - Infrastructure maintenances
